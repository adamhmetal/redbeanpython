# Beans

All operations in RedBeanPython are done on **Beans** objects. **Beans** works similar, but not identical, as **ORM** objects in other **ORM** libraries.

**Bean** object makes use of the corresponding (autogenerated) SQLAlchemy Model (if you want to know more, see [hybrid mode](hybrid_mode.md))

## Dispense

Beans can be created just by passing their type to the Bean class.

```python
user = Bean('user')
```

And their property can be added just as an object property:

```python
user.name = "Adam"
user.age = 42
```

or via a dictionary-like interface

```python
user['name'] = "Adam"
user['age'] = 42
```

### An alternative way to create beans is to use the `dispense` method on engine object


```python
user = redbean.dispense('user')
user['name'] = "Adam"
user['age'] = 42
```

## Dispense many


Use `Beans()` syntactic sugar notation to dispense many beans at once.

```python
users = Beans('user', count=10) # (1)
# ... fill beans with data...
redbean.store_many(users)

users = Beans('user', data=[{"name": "Adam"}, {"name": "Eve"}]) # (2)
redbean.store_many(users)
```

1. will dispense ten empty beans
2. will dispense beans from the list of dict data

An alternative syntax is to use `dispense_many` method

```python
users = redbean.dispense_many('user', count=10) #(1)
# ... fill beans with data...
redbean.store_many(users)

users = redbean.dispense_many('user', data=[{"name": "Adam"}, {"name": "Eve"}]) #(2)
redbean.store_many(users)
```

1. will dispense ten empty beans
2. will dispense beans from the list of dict data

:warning: `store_many` is a syntactic sugar only. It will not store records in bulk. It will be enough for most situations, but if you need to speed up storing many records at once, use [Bulk operations](bulk_operations.md)

## Cast to dict

For convenience, beans can be cast to dict with the standard Python way:

```python
user = Bean('user')
user['name'] = "Adam"
user['age'] = 42
print(dict(user))

redbean.store(user)

loaded = redbean.load('user', user.id)
print(dict(loaded))
```

```python
{
    'age': 42,
    'id': 'ab58f89d-5543-4e94-a3c8-854674c420f4', 
    'name': 'Adam'
}
```
