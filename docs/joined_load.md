# Joined load

Joined load is out of the scope of RedBeanPython by design, as if we have such use cases hybrid mode and sql alchemy directly should be used in such places.

## Joined load

```python
session = redbean.session_maker() # (1)
query = session.query(Customer, Invoice) # (2)
query = query.filter(Customer.id == Invoice.customer_id)
query = query.filter(Invoice.amount > 10)
result = query.all()
for customer, invoice in result:
    print(customer.name, invoice.amount)
```

1. Get SQLAlchemy session from redbean (single point of initialization)
2. Use autogenerated (by redbean) SQLAlchemy model
3. Add relations mapping

The current RedBeanPython version does not support relations, so you have to do it manually.
```python
# (...)
query = session.query(Customer, Invoice)
query = query.filter(Customer.id == Invoice.customer_id)
# (...)
```
:information: Relations are planned to be supported in further versions.
